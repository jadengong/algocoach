## üóÑÔ∏è Database Access

Visit `http://localhost:8081/h2-console` to view the database:
- **JDBC URL**: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
- **Username**: `sa`
- **Password**: `password`

## üìä Sample Data

The application comes pre-loaded with:
- 8 algorithm problems (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Detailed descriptions, examples, and constraints
- Topics: Array, Stack, Dynamic Programming, Hash Table, String, Linked List

## üîç Advanced Problem Discovery (NEW!)

The enhanced AlgoCoach now includes **smart problem discovery** with advanced filtering and pagination:

### New Features
- **Pagination**: Browse problems page by page (default 10 per page)
- **Multiple Sorting Options**: Sort by difficulty, acceptance rate, or title
- **Smart Filtering**: Filter by difficulty and topic with real-time results
- **Personalized Discovery**: MVP endpoint excludes already solved problems
- **Filter Discovery**: Get available topics, difficulties, and sort options

### API Endpoints
- `GET /problems/filters` - Get available filter options
- `GET /problems/discover` - Public problem discovery with pagination
- `GET /mvp/problems/discover` - Personalized discovery (excludes solved problems)

### Example Response
```json
{
  "problems": [...],
  "totalCount": 8,
  "page": 0,
  "size": 5,
  "totalPages": 2,
  "hasNext": true,
  "hasPrevious": false,
  "filters": {
    "difficulty": "EASY",
    "topic": "all",
    "sortBy": "acceptance"
  }
}
```

## üß† Confidence Scoring System (NEW!)

The enhanced AlgoCoach now includes a **smart confidence scoring system** that makes problem recommendations more intelligent:

### How It Works
- **Automatic Calculation**: Confidence score (0.0-1.0) calculated based on:
  - Number of attempts (fewer = higher confidence)
  - Hints used (fewer = higher confidence) 
  - Time spent (faster = higher confidence)
- **Manual Input**: Users can also provide their own confidence rating
- **Smart Recommendations**: System uses confidence scores to suggest appropriate difficulty levels

### Benefits
- **Adaptive Learning**: Recommendations improve as users solve more problems
- **Confidence Tracking**: Users can see their confidence levels by difficulty/topic
- **Better Progression**: Prevents users from jumping to problems too hard/easy for their skill level

### API Response Example
```json
{
  "message": "Problem solved!",
  "progress": {
    "confidenceScore": 0.75,
    "attemptsCount": 2,
    "hintsUsed": 1,
    "timeSpentMinutes": 25
  },
  "confidenceScore": 0.75
}
```

## üîñ Problem Bookmarks (NEW!)

The enhanced AlgoCoach now includes **problem bookmarking** functionality:

### How It Works
- **Toggle Bookmarks**: Click to bookmark/unbookmark any problem
- **Persistent Storage**: Bookmarks are saved per user
- **Easy Access**: View all bookmarked problems in one place
- **Smart Integration**: Works with existing progress tracking

### API Endpoints
- `POST /mvp/problems/{id}/bookmark` - Toggle bookmark status
- `GET /mvp/bookmarks` - Get all bookmarked problems

### Example Usage
```bash
# Bookmark a problem
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/mvp/problems/1/bookmark \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Get bookmarked problems
